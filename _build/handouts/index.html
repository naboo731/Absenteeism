<h1>Designing Visualizations of Absenteeism</h1>
<section class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you will follow a thoughtful approach to designing a visualization
of a dataset that is ripe for analysis – a dataset with instances of worker
absenteeism, along with social and other demographic data about the worker.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="setup">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>First, download and explore the dataset we’ll use in this exercise
at the link below. Note that the dataset is downloadable as a TSV
(tab separasted values) rather than our typical CSV.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://data.world/aaizemberg/absenteeismatwork" target="_blank">https://data.world/aaizemberg/absenteeismatwork</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that you have watching the Pluralsight Course
<a class="reference external" href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/designing-data-visualizations/table-of-contents" target="_blank">Designing Data Visualizations</a>
and that you are familiar with the content covered in the course.</p>
<p>Lastly, create a Jupyter notebook to use for this project.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="the-scenario">
<h2>The Scenario</h2>
<p>There is a summit of managers who are meeting to discuss employee happiness and satisfaction.
The managers work for a variety of companies in various industries. One of the panels
will discuss worker absenteeism in order to understand how to craft a more modern,
flexible Paid Time Off policy for the future of work.</p>
<p>As a data analyst who works for one of the managers on the absenteeism panel, you have been
tasked with conducting an analysis on large available dataset of absenteeism to draw out
insights that might be helpful for the panel discussion.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="spotting-data-relationships">
<h2>Spotting Data Relationships</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>In your Jupyter notebook, go through the <strong>5 W’s + 1</strong> (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How)
for your analysis on the absenteeism data.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, conduct an exploratory data analysis on the data set. What are some of the averages, minimums,
and maximums for the various columns? Allow your <strong>curiosity</strong> to take over here. Make sure to use
the Jupyter notebook Markdown functionality to include explanations for your exploration in this
section.</p></li>
<li><p>Employing the skill of <strong>skepticism</strong>, attempt to avoid the trap of “Hyman’s Maxim” (copied below for
your convenience) by checking your data for <strong>4 types of Null Hypotheses</strong> (detailed below). For
each null hypothesis, include a description of how you disproved it using data exploration examples.</p></li>
</ol>
<section class="section" id="avoiding-data-traps">
<h3>Avoiding Data Traps</h3>
<p><strong>Hyman’s Maxim: Don’t try to explain HOW something works until you have confirmed that it does, in fact, work.</strong></p>
<p>In order to be sure you are building your analysis on a solid foundation, you need to check
your data for quality. You can do this by looking at the following four types of Null Hypotheses and confirming
that they are not present in your dataset.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Correlation Null Hypothesis: Two different traits, such as whether someone is a social drinker and whether
they are a social smoker, are not actually different. This should not be the case because statistically,
there must be at least a few people who are ONLY social smokers or ONLY social drinkers, or NEITHER.</p></li>
<li><p>Independent Samples Null Hypothesis: Two different populations (such as people younger than 30 and older than 40) actually
behave the same. This should not be the case because different populations should have different habits.</p></li>
<li><p>Chi-squared independence Null Hypothesis: Two things that ARE definitely related don’t seem to have a relationship
in the data. For example, distance from work and transportation expense most certainly should have a relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeated measures Null Hypothesis: Depite changing conditions or time, the measure or behavior does not change. For example,
tracking a single ID would give you the all absences for a single employee. With a repeated measure for an employee, we
would expect values for “reason for absence”, “average workload”, etc to change with time.</p></li>
</ol>

<section class="section" id="choosing-relationships-to-visualize">
<h2>Choosing Relationships to Visualize</h2>
<p>In this section, you’ll explore relationships within the Absenteeism datset.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>First, upload your TSV to Google Sheets.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, setup Conditional Formatting to provide meaningful coloring to the various
values in your dataset. You will need to consider the range (min, max) for each
column and set up conditional formatting to be appropriate for each set of values.
For example, a column that is Boolean (either 0 or 1), you might want to use red/green
to mean 0/1 respectively. For a column with values ranging from 1-100, you might
use dark green for 90-100, light green for 80-90, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Use sorting to investigate relationships between the columns. What insights can you find
that might help managers design a better PTO policy for their companies?</p></li>
<li><p>In your Jupyter notebook, list out the signals you have spotted in the data based
on your spreadsheet analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section class="section" id="visualize">
<h2>Visualize!</h2>
<p>Now that you have completed the important design and prep work to create a quality and
meaningful visualization, create 3-5 visualizations to provide to your manager to use at
the “Designing A Better PTO Policy” panel. For each visualization, list 1-2 key insights
to be drawn from it in your Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p><strong>When you have finished, be sure to upload your Jupyter notebook to your Github to
turn in this exercise.</strong></p>
